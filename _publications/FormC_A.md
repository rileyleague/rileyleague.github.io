**Abstract:** While there exists a vast literature exploring the benefits of mandated financial disclosure, few have documented the direct cost of issuing financial statements. Using a sample of start-up firms where the costs and benefits of financial reporting may be most material, we examine entrepreneurs’ willingness to sacrifice further invested capital during a securities offering in order to avoid preparing updated financial statements. First, we show a dramatic increase in offering closures immediately before their deadline to file updated financials. Then, we estimate a model of entrepreneurs’ offering closure decisions to recover the distribution of reporting costs. We find that 64% of issuers are willing to close their raise at least one month early to avoid reporting, with 34% of issuers willing to close at least six months early. In the aggregate, these results indicate financial statement reporting requirements for Regulation Crowdfunding issuers have reduced the amount of investment in this market by at least $57 million.
