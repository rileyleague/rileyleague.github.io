excerpt: "We consider how health care providers respond to bundled payments. Using claims data from dialysis patients, we show that facilities halved their use of injectable anemia drugs following Medicare's transition from fee-for-service reimbursements to a bundle. We identify the causal effects of the payment reform using a novel instrumental variable--patients at higher elevations naturally require lower doses of anemia drugs--and find that lower doses caused a decrease in mortality but an increase in blood transfusions. Allocative efficiency increased from this change as providers reduced doses more for patients who benefit little from the drug."

We consider how health care providers respond to bundled payments. Using claims data from dialysis patients, we show that facilities halved their use of injectable anemia drugs following Medicare's transition from fee-for-service reimbursements to a bundle. We identify the causal effects of the payment reform using a novel instrumental variable--patients at higher elevations naturally require lower doses of anemia drugs--and find that lower doses caused a decrease in mortality but an increase in blood transfusions. Allocative efficiency increased from this change as providers reduced doses more for patients who benefit little from the drug.
