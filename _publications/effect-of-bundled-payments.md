**Abstract:** We study the use and effectiveness of epoetin alfa (EPO), historically one of Medicare's largest drug expenses. Using a novel instrumental variable based on elevation and a large payment reform, we estimate a model of providers' treatment decisions that incorporates the heterogeneous effect EPO has on patients. We find that increasing doses by 1% reduces anemia by 0.1%, on average, but increases heart attacks by 0.3% and mortality by 0.4%, with patients exhibiting substantial heterogeneity along these dimensions. Our counterfactual analysis shows that patients' well-being would decline considerably if providers disregarded their heterogeneous responses as mandated by some Medicare guidelines.
