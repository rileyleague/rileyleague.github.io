excerpt: "We consider how health care providers respond to bundled payments. Using claims data from dialysis patients, we show that facilities halved their use of injectable anemia drugs following Medicare's transition from fee-for-service reimbursements to a bundle. We identify the causal effects of the payment reform using a novel instrumental variable--patients at higher elevations naturally require lower doses of anemia drugs--and find that lower doses caused a decrease in mortality but an increase in blood transfusions. Allocative efficiency increased from this change as providers reduced doses more for patients who benefit little from the drug."

**Abstract:** We consider how health care providers respond to bundled payments. Using claims data from dialysis patients, we show that facilities halved their use of injectable aneWe consider how health care providers respond to changes in the composition of bundled payments. After Medicare switched from fee-for-service reimbursements to a bundle, dialysis facilities halved their use of injectable anemia drugs. We identify the causal effects of this change using a novel source of variation—patients at higher elevations naturally require lower doses of anemia drugs—and show the reduction caused mortality to decline but transfusions to rise. Providers reduced costs by allowing spillovers to treatments outside the bundle and increased allocative efficiency by cutting doses more for patients who receive little benefit from the drug.
