title: "High Prices and Wide Dispersion in Private Insurance Payments for Dialysis Services"

excerpt: "It is commonly thought that commercial plans reimburse dialysis facilities much more generously than Medicare does, and recent policy proposals have sought to limit the amount that dialysis providers can charge private payers. A lack of comprehensive data, however, has so far precluded a systematic analysis on the actual level and dispersion of commercial prices for dialysis. We analyze claims from 2012-2019 for in-center hemodialysis procedures for a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance claims to provide the most comprehensive evidence to date on the cost of dialysis borne by private payers. We limit the sample to claims with a positive payment amount for a single outpatient hemodialysis session rendered by a dialysis treatment facility to a patient under age 65 for whom employer-sponsored insurance is the primary insurance coverage. We limit the sample to patients who have at most 14 dialysis sessions reported in a month and who are within 33 months of their first dialysis claim. Lastly, we drop the top 1\% of observed prices. These restrictions yield a sample of over 1.9 million claims. We find that the median private price of a dialysis session is \$1,476 (95\% confidence interval [CI], \$1,476-\$1,476), more than six times the top Medicare base rate during our sample period. For those patients who bear some financial responsibility for receiving dialysis, the average patient pays \$256.39 (95\% CI, \$254.98-\$257.80). We find that the median price increased 22.7\% over our sample period and that the average state-level price ranges from \$950 (95\% CI, \$927.97-\$971.47) to \$1,791 (95\% CI, \$1785.10-\$1796.34). The price that private insurers pay for dialysis is much higher than Medicare’s rate, has increased substantially from 2012-2019, and varies greatly across the US."

**Abstract:** It is commonly thought that commercial plans reimburse dialysis facilities much more generously than Medicare does, and recent policy proposals have sought to limit the amount that dialysis providers can charge private payers. A lack of comprehensive data, however, has so far precluded a systematic analysis on the actual level and dispersion of commercial prices for dialysis. We analyze claims from 2012-2019 for in-center hemodialysis procedures for a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance claims to provide the most comprehensive evidence to date on the cost of dialysis borne by private payers. We limit the sample to claims with a positive payment amount for a single outpatient hemodialysis session rendered by a dialysis treatment facility to a patient under age 65 for whom employer-sponsored insurance is the primary insurance coverage. We limit the sample to patients who have at most 14 dialysis sessions reported in a month and who are within 33 months of their first dialysis claim. Lastly, we drop the top 1\% of observed prices. These restrictions yield a sample of over 1.9 million claims. We find that the median private price of a dialysis session is \$1,476 (95\% confidence interval [CI], \$1,476-\$1,476), more than six times the top Medicare base rate during our sample period. For those patients who bear some financial responsibility for receiving dialysis, the average patient pays \$256.39 (95\% CI, \$254.98-\$257.80). We find that the median price increased 22.7\% over our sample period and that the average state-level price ranges from \$950 (95\% CI, \$927.97-\$971.47) to \$1,791 (95\% CI, \$1785.10-\$1796.34). The price that private insurers pay for dialysis is much higher than Medicare’s rate, has increased substantially from 2012-2019, and varies greatly across the US.
