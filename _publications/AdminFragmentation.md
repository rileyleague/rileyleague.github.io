**Abstract:** This paper examines the impact of reducing the administrative fragmentation of billing and payment, one commonly cited cause of inefficiency in US health care. We study a Medicare reform that consolidated billing processes across service types, using its staggered rollout and hospitalsâ€™ prior levels of administrative fragmentation for identification. The reform dramatically reduced fragmentation and modestly lowered claim denial rates but had no effect on spending, post-discharge care, or rehospitalizations. It also did not affect administrative costs or technology adoption. These findings suggest that addressing administrative fragmentation alone is unlikely to significantly improve health care efficiency.
