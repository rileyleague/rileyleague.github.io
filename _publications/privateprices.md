title: "Variability of Prices Paid for Hemodialysis by Employer-Sponsored Insurance in the US, 2012-2019"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/privateprices
excerpt: "Question: How does the price private insurers pay for hemodialysis services compare to that paid by Medicare, and how does this price vary across time and geography? Findings: In this cross-sectional study of a large sample of claims from employer-sponsored insurance plans, we find that the median price paid by private insurers for outpatient hemodialysis services is $1,476, more than six times the base rate paid by Medicare. Furthermore, we find substantial, statistically significant differences in price across states. Meaning: Lowering the prices paid by private insurers to Medicare rates and discouraging steering patients onto private plans, as proposed by policymakers, would result in substantial savings in spending on hemodialysis."
