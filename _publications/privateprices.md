excerpt: "Approximately 20% of the 500,000 patients who receive dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US are covered by commercial insurance, with the rest having Medicare as their primary payer. It is commonly thought that commercial plans reimburse dialysis facilities much more generously than Medicare does. Due to a lack of comprehensive data, however, limited evidence has shown precisely how actual commercial prices compare to Medicare’s or how they have changed over time. We provide novel empirical evidence on dialysis prices for a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance carriers for 2012 through 2019. We analyze claims from 2012-2019 for in-center hemodialysis procedures from a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance claims. We limit the sample to claims with a positive payment amount for a single outpatient hemodialysis session (CPT code 90999, length of claim of one day, one unit reported, TOB 721, revenue code 0821) rendered by a dialysis treatment facility (POS 65) to a patient under age 65 for whom employer-sponsored insurance is the primary insurance coverage. We further limit the sample to patients who have at most 14 dialysis sessions reported in a month and who are within 33 months of their first dialysis claim. These restrictions yield a sample of roughly 2 million claims for over 25,000 patients. We find that the median private price of a dialysis session is approximately \$1480, more than six times the top Medicare base rate during our sample period of \$240.36. These prices have increased over time and vary based on the geographic location of the dialysis provider. We find that the average state-level private price of a dialysis session ranges from less than \$1,000 to almost \$1,800, that prices in urban areas are almost twice as high as those in rural areas, and that the median price has increased from $1349 at the beginning of 2012 to \$1655 by the end of 2019. The price that private insurers pay for dialysis is much higher than Medicare’s rate, has increased substantially from 2012-2019, and varies substantially across the US."

**Abstract:** Approximately 20% of the 500,000 patients who receive dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the US are covered by commercial insurance, with the rest having Medicare as their primary payer. It is commonly thought that commercial plans reimburse dialysis facilities much more generously than Medicare does. Due to a lack of comprehensive data, however, limited evidence has shown precisely how actual commercial prices compare to Medicare’s or how they have changed over time. We provide novel empirical evidence on dialysis prices for a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance carriers for 2012 through 2019. We analyze claims from 2012-2019 for in-center hemodialysis procedures from a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance claims. We limit the sample to claims with a positive payment amount for a single outpatient hemodialysis session (CPT code 90999, length of claim of one day, one unit reported, TOB 721, revenue code 0821) rendered by a dialysis treatment facility (POS 65) to a patient under age 65 for whom employer-sponsored insurance is the primary insurance coverage. We further limit the sample to patients who have at most 14 dialysis sessions reported in a month and who are within 33 months of their first dialysis claim. These restrictions yield a sample of roughly 2 million claims for over 25,000 patients. We find that the median private price of a dialysis session is approximately \$1480, more than six times the top Medicare base rate during our sample period of \$240.36. These prices have increased over time and vary based on the geographic location of the dialysis provider. We find that the average state-level private price of a dialysis session ranges from less than \$1,000 to almost \$1,800, that prices in urban areas are almost twice as high as those in rural areas, and that the median price has increased from $1349 at the beginning of 2012 to \$1655 by the end of 2019. The price that private insurers pay for dialysis is much higher than Medicare’s rate, has increased substantially from 2012-2019, and varies substantially across the US.
