excerpt: "It is commonly thought that commercial plans reimburse dialysis facilities much more generously than Medicare does, and recent policy proposals have sought to limit the amount that dialysis providers can charge private payers. A lack of comprehensive data, however, has so far precluded a systematic analysis on the actual level and dispersion of commercial prices for dialysis. We analyze claims from 2012-2019 for in-center hemodialysis procedures for a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance claims to provide the most comprehensive evidence to date on the cost of dialysis borne by private payers. We limit the sample to claims with a positive payment amount for a single outpatient hemodialysis session rendered by a dialysis treatment facility. We limit the sample to exclude patients possibly on Medicare or who have implausible treatment frequencies. These restrictions yield a sample of over 1.9 million claims. We find that the median private price of a dialysis session is $1,476 (95% confidence interval [CI], $1,476-$1,476), more than six times the top Medicare base rate during our sample period. For those patients who bear some financial responsibility for receiving dialysis, the average patient pays $256.39 (95% CI, $254.98-$257.80). We find that the median price increased 22.7% over our sample period and that the average state-level price ranges from $950 (95% CI, $927.97-$971.47) to $1,791 (95% CI, $1785.10-$1796.34). The price that private insurers pay for dialysis is much higher than Medicare’s rate, has increased substantially from 2012-2019, and varies greatly across the US."

**Abstract:** It is commonly thought that commercial plans reimburse dialysis facilities much more generously than Medicare does, and recent policy proposals have sought to limit the amount that dialysis providers can charge private payers. A lack of comprehensive data, however, has so far precluded a systematic analysis on the actual level and dispersion of commercial prices for dialysis. We analyze claims from 2012-2019 for in-center hemodialysis procedures for a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance claims to provide the most comprehensive evidence to date on the cost of dialysis borne by private payers. We limit the sample to claims with a positive payment amount for a single outpatient hemodialysis session rendered by a dialysis treatment facility. We limit the sample to exclude patients possibly on Medicare or who have implausible treatment frequencies. These restrictions yield a sample of over 1.9 million claims. We find that the median private price of a dialysis session is 1,476 dollars (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1,476-1,476), more than six times the top Medicare base rate during our sample period. For those patients who bear some financial responsibility for receiving dialysis, the average patient pays 256.39 dollars (95 percent CI, 254.98-257.80). We find that the median price increased 22.7 percent over our sample period and that the average state-level price ranges from 950 (95 percent CI, 927.97-971.47) to 1,791 dollars (95 percent CI, 1785.10-1796.34). The price that private insurers pay for dialysis is much higher than Medicare’s rate, has increased substantially from 2012-2019, and varies greatly across the US.
