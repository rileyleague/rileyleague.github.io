title: "Large Increases in Health Care Spending Among Privately Insured Patients Initiating Dialysis Care"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/privateinitiate
excerpt: "Despite a widespread belief that private insurers spend large amounts on health care for enrollees on dialysis, data limitations have so far precluded a comprehensive analysis of the topic. We analyze claims data from a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance claims of enrollees who initiate dialysis care. We limit the sample to beneficiaries continuously enrolled in the 12 months prior to their first claim for dialysis care and the 12 months after. We then compare the monthly spending overall and by type of care before and after these patients initiate dialysis, controlling for patient and plan characteristics. We find that total monthly spending increases $13,951 (95% confidence interval [CI], $13,708-$14,195) following the average enrollee’s first dialysis treatment. This change stems from increases across all categories of spending (dialysis, non-dialysis outpatient, inpatient, physician services, and prescription drug). Monthly patient out-of-pocket spending increases $175 (95% CI, $167-$182). These spending increases occur abruptly at the initiation of dialysis, with only a small uptick in spending before beginning dialysis. When a privately insured patient initiates dialysis, their insurer experiences a significant and sustained increase in spending."

**Abstract:** Despite a widespread belief that private insurers spend large amounts on health care for enrollees on dialysis, data limitations have so far precluded a comprehensive analysis of the topic. We analyze claims data from a large, national sample of private employer-sponsored insurance claims of enrollees who initiate dialysis care. We limit the sample to beneficiaries continuously enrolled in the 12 months prior to their first claim for dialysis care and the 12 months after. We then compare the monthly spending overall and by type of care before and after these patients initiate dialysis, controlling for patient and plan characteristics. We find that total monthly spending increases 13,951 dollars (95 percent confidence interval, 13,708-14,195) following the average enrollee’s first dialysis treatment. This change stems from increases across all categories of spending (dialysis, non-dialysis outpatient, inpatient, physician services, and prescription drug). Monthly patient out-of-pocket spending increases 175 dollars (CI, 167-182). These spending increases occur abruptly at the initiation of dialysis, with only a small uptick in spending before beginning dialysis. When a privately insured patient initiates dialysis, their insurer experiences a significant and sustained increase in spending.
