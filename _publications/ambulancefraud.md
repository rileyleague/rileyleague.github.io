excerpt: "To combat Medicare fraud, regulators use a mix of criminal and civil lawsuits along with administrative procedures such as prior authorization. We study the relative effects of these methods by focusing specifically on ambulance reimbursements for dialysis patients, on which Medicare spent $7.7 billion from 2003 to 2017 for regularly scheduled, non-emergency rides to and from dialysis facilities. Using a novel data set and a difference-in-differences research design based on the staggered rollout of these actions and policies across the U.S., we find that stricter requirements for documenting a medical necessity greatly reduced spending on dialysis ambulance transports, whereas criminal and civil lawsuits had a much smaller effect. Despite the sharp drop in both ambulance transports and the companies that provide them following prior authorization, we find no impact on patients' health, indicating that most rides had little medical benefit. Our results suggest that additional paperwork deters fraud much more than targeted criminal enforcement does, providing novel evidence for the cost-effectiveness of anti-fraud policies in Medicare."

**Abstract:** To combat Medicare fraud, regulators use a mix of criminal and civil lawsuits along with administrative procedures such as prior authorization. We study the relative effects of these methods by focusing specifically on ambulance reimbursements for dialysis patients, on which Medicare spent $7.7 billion from 2003 to 2017 for regularly scheduled, non-emergency rides to and from dialysis facilities. Using a novel data set and a difference-in-differences research design based on the staggered rollout of these actions and policies across the U.S., we find that stricter requirements for documenting a medical necessity greatly reduced spending on dialysis ambulance transports, whereas criminal and civil lawsuits had a much smaller effect. Despite the sharp drop in both ambulance transports and the companies that provide them following prior authorization, we find no impact on patients' health, indicating that most rides had little medical benefit. Our results suggest that additional paperwork deters fraud much more than targeted criminal enforcement does, providing novel evidence for the cost-effectiveness of anti-fraud policies in Medicare.
