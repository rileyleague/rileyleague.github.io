**Abstract:** We study the effectiveness of pay-and-chase lawsuits and upfront regulations for combating health care fraud. Between 2003 and 2017, Medicare spent $7.7 billion on 37.5 million regularly scheduled ambulance rides for patients traveling to and from dialysis facilities even though many did not satisfy Medicareâ€™s criteria for receiving reimbursements. Using an identification strategy based on the staggered timing of regulations and lawsuits across the US, we find that adding a prior authorization requirement for ambulance reimbursements reduced spending much more than pursuing criminal and civil litigation did on their own. We find no evidence that prior authorization affected patients' health.
