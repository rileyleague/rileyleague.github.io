title: "The Impact of Private Medicare Administrators on Health Care Delivery"

excerpt: 'Geographic variation in health care delivery and spending is a prominent feature of the US health care landscape, but few supply-side drivers of this variation have been conclusively identified. In this paper, I highlight the role that the private companies that administer Traditional Medicare, called MACs, play in contributing to geographic variation in care. I exploit exogenous changes in MAC jurisdiction boundaries to identify the causal effect of each company on health care spending, administrative burdens, and health care delivery. I find that MACs vary widely in their propensity to deny medical claims, but provider respond to more frequent denials by billing more aggressively, mitigating the impact on health care spending. These results highlight the contribution of Medicare's decentralized structure to geographic variation in medical practice and health care spending.'

**Abstract:** Geographic variation in health care delivery and spending is a prominent feature of the US health care landscape, but few supply-side drivers of this variation have been conclusively identified. In this paper, I highlight the role that the private companies that administer Traditional Medicare, called MACs, play in contributing to geographic variation in care. I exploit exogenous changes in MAC jurisdiction boundaries to identify the causal effect of each company on health care spending, administrative burdens, and health care delivery. I find that MACs vary widely in their propensity to deny medical claims, but provider respond to more frequent denials by billing more aggressively, mitigating the impact on health care spending. These results highlight the contribution of Medicare's decentralized structure to geographic variation in medical practice and health care spending.
