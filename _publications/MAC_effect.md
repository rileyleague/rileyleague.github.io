title: "Administrative Burden and Consolidation in Health Care: Evidence from Medicare Contractor Transitions"
collection: publications
permalink: /publications/MAC_effect
excerpt: "The US health care system is rife with administrative burdens, but little is known about their causal effects on provider behavior. Using exogenous changes to the jurisdictions of Medicare Administrative Contractors, I show that the resulting increase in claim denials causes providers to adopt cost-saving technologies, bill more aggressively, and consolidate into larger practices. Despite denying more claims, Medicare spending increases as a result of providers' endogenous responses. I explain this counterintuitive result using a model of firms' investment in billing effort and technology. Estimates from this model show that investment costs amount to $89 billion per year and that increasing administrative burdens reduces providers' profits by 4-6% while raising Medicare spending, thus making both providers and the government worse off. Counterfactual simulations indicate that increased administrative burdens would result in substantial reductions in health care spending were providers unable to adjust investment, highlighting the short-run incentives insurers may have to raise administrative burdens."

**Abstract:** The US health care system is rife with administrative burdens, but little is known about their causal effects on provider behavior. Using exogenous changes to the jurisdictions of Medicare Administrative Contractors, I show that the resulting increase in claim denials causes providers to adopt cost-saving technologies, bill more aggressively, and consolidate into larger practices. Despite denying more claims, Medicare spending increases as a result of providers' endogenous responses. I explain this counterintuitive result using a model of firms' investment in billing effort and technology. Estimates from this model show that investment costs amount to \$89 billion per year and that increasing administrative burdens reduces providers' profits by 4-6\% while raising Medicare spending, thus making both providers and the government worse off. Counterfactual simulations indicate that increased administrative burdens would result in substantial reductions in health care spending were providers unable to adjust investment, highlighting the short-run incentives insurers may have to raise administrative burdens.
