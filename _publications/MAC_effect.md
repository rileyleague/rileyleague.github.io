**Abstract:** The US health care system is characterized by high administrative costs, the effects of which are theoretically ambiguous. Using exogenous changes to the jurisdictions of Medicare Administrative Contractors, I show that increases in a prominent type of administrative burden, claim denials, cause providers to invest in billing and consolidate into larger practices. These endogenous responses by providers fully offset the mechanical reduction in Medicare spending we would expect from the increase in claim denials. I explain this counterintuitive result using a model of firmsâ€™ investment in billing, estimates of which show that billing costs amount to \$89 billion annually.
