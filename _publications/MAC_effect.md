excerpt: "The US health care system is rife with administrative burdens, including those imposed on providers by claim denials. Nonetheless, there is little evidence on the response of providers to changes in this burden. In this paper, I examine provider responses to changes in the administrative burden they face following consolidation in the administrative jurisdictions of Medicare contractors. Using a two-way fixed effects model, I exploit the transition of jurisdictions across contractors to identify the effect of each contractor on the denial rate faced by providers, finding wide variation in denial rates across contractors. I then investigate the responses of providers to transitions of their jurisdiction across contractors imposing different levels of administrative burden. I find that providers alter their billing practices in the months following a transition as providers comply with new billing rules. When exposed to more frequent denials, providers respond by billing more aggressively, with this response negating the effect of more aggressive denials on net Medicare spending. I also find that for low value services, very large changes in the denial rate can induce providers to decrease their use of the procedure. My results indicate that administrative burdens must be targeted and salient to achieve their desired effect."

**Abstract:** The US health care system is rife with administrative burdens, including those imposed on providers by claim denials. However, there is little evidence on the response of providers to changes in this burden. In this paper, I examine provider responses to changes in the billing frictions they face following consolidation in the administratively set jurisdictions of Medicare contractors. I find that following the transition to an administrator that imposes greater burdens, providers respond by adopting cost-saving technology and billing more aggressively, with this response outweighing the increased denials such that overall Medicare spending increases. Furthermore, increased burden leads to consolidation, with the number of entities billing Medicare falling and the average size of these entities rising following increases in burden. These results are consistent with the predictions of a simple model of provider investment in billing technology. Estimating this model, I find that investment costs are $1 million a month for the average practice and that recent investment subsidies resulted in larger increases in Medicare spending than direct subsidy payments.
