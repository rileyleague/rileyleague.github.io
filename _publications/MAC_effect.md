excerpt: "The US health care system is rife with administrative burdens, including those imposed on providers by claim denials. However, there is little evidence on the response of providers to changes in this burden. Using exogenous changes to the jurisdictions of Medicare Administrative Contractors, I show that administrative burdens cause providers to adopt cost-saving technologies, bill more aggressively, and consolidate into larger practices. Despite an increase in denial rates following a change in contractors, Medicare spending increases as a result of providers' endogenous responses. I estimate a simple model of provider investment in billing technology to show that investment costs are $1 million a month for the average practice and that increasing administrative burdens lowers provider profits and raises Medicare spending, making both parties worse off."

**Abstract:** The US health care system is rife with administrative burdens, including those imposed on providers by claim denials. However, there is little evidence on the response of providers to changes in this burden. Using exogenous changes to the jurisdictions of Medicare Administrative Contractors, I show that administrative burdens cause providers to adopt cost-saving technologies, bill more aggressively, and consolidate into larger practices. Despite an increase in denial rates following a change in contractors, Medicare spending increases as a result of providers' endogenous responses. I estimate a simple model of provider investment in billing technology to show that investment costs are $1 million a month for the average practice and that increasing administrative burdens lowers provider profits and raises Medicare spending, making both parties worse off.
