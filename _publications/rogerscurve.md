**Summary:** Everett Rogers diffusion theory of innovations has been widely applied to examine the timeline for the adoption of new ideas in several domains ranging from agriculture to healthcare, but has not been used to better understand the adoption of new medications, technologies, and procedures in anaesthesia practice. We explored the uptake of sugammadex within a large nationwide sample of US hospitals between January 2016 and June 2018, the 30-month period after approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
