**Key Points:** 

_Question_: How did facility ownership in the US dialysis industry evolve between 2005 and 2019, and what is its association with commercial prices and medical director compensation?

_Findings_: In this economic evaluation, between 2005 and 2019, the US dialysis industry consolidated both horizontally and vertically, with the share of facilities operated by the 2 largest dialysis chains, DaVita and Fresenius, increasing from 59.1% to 77.1% and the share with a physician owner increasing from 11.4% to 29.1%. During this period, markets with only 1 large chain had $495.08 higher commercial prices for outpatient hemodialysis and $564.56 higher medical director compensation per patient compared to markets without large chain facilities.   

_Meaning_: This study highlights the growing consolidation in the US dialysis industry, both horizontally and vertically, and its associations with higher commercial prices for outpatient hemodialysis and compensation for medical directors.
