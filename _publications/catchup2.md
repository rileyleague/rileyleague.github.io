Early-life shocks often produce negative long-run consequences lasting into adulthood, but little is known about how childhood social programs interact with early-life environments. In this paper, we use delays in enrollment from the rollout of Brazil's Bolsa Fam√≠lia program to analyze how longer duration of benefit receipt interacts with variation in early-life conditions coming from in utero rainfall shocks. We find that the duration of Bolsa treatment impacts stunting, obesity, and other health outcomes, with the program driving catch-up growth by being most effective among children whose in utero conditions predisposed them to worse health outcomes..
