I developed content and conducted a brief, real-time session to prepare incoming Masters of Science and Quantitative Management (MSQM) students for the mathematics concepts they would encounter in their studies in Fall 2020. Following positive feedback from students, I developed a more extensive course to be delivered via pre-recorded and professionally-edited content in future years.
