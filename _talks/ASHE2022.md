At this conference, I presented research on multiple different topics, including 
1. Research on the negotiation process between dialysis providers and private insurers,
2. Research on how pricing mechanisms and regulation have been used to combat fraud in the medical device industry, and
3. Research on the impact of private Medicare administrators on administrative costs and health care delivery.

More information on this last strand of research can be found [here](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/MAC_effect).
