This page contains various things I've put together that others may find useful. I plan to add more over time. If you have a suggestion on what to add, please let me know.

This is a guide Mark Shepard and I put together on commonly-used data sources for health economics research.

This is a crosswalk between Medicare Part B contractors and the areas they processed claims for from 1999--2017.

This is a crosswalk between ZIP codes and sub-state Medicare contract areas.

This is a crosswalk between the contract numbers used by CMS (see [here](https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/carrier-or-mac-number) and [here](https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/fi-or-mac-number)) and the name of the contractor operating the contract.

This is a crosswalk between the state codes used by the Social Security Administration and CMS and the state FIPS codes commonly used elsewhere.
