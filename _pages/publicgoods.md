This page contains various things I've put together that others may find useful. I plan to add more over time. If you have a suggestion on what to add, please let me know.

## Data
***

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/Health Data Guide for NBER Mentoring Session - May 2024.docx) is a guide Mark Shepard and I put together on commonly-used data sources for health economics research.

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/MAC_jurisdiction_Xwalk.dta) is a crosswalk between Medicare Part B contractors and the areas they processed claims for from 1999--2017.

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/zip_to_juri_Xwalk.dta) is a crosswalk between ZIP codes and sub-state Medicare contract areas.

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/carr_num_Xwalk.dta) is a crosswalk between the contract numbers used by CMS (see [here](https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/carrier-or-mac-number) and [here](https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/fi-or-mac-number)) and the name of the contractor operating the contract.

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/state_ssafips_Xwalk.dta) is a crosswalk between the state codes used by the Social Security Administration and CMS and the state FIPS codes commonly used elsewhere.
