This page contains various things I've put together that others may find useful. I plan to add more over time. If you have a suggestion on what to add, please let me know.

## Data
***

[This](https://github.com/rileyleague/rileyleague.github.io/blob/master/files/Health%20Data%20Guide%20for%20NBER%20Mentoring%20Session%20-%20May%202024.docx) is a guide Mark Shepard and I put together on commonly used data sources for health economics research.

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/MAC_jurisdiction_Xwalk.dta) is a crosswalk between Medicare Part B contractors and the areas they processed claims for from 1999--2017.

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/zip_to_juri_Xwalk.dta) is a crosswalk between ZIP codes and sub-state Medicare contract areas.

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/carr_num_Xwalk.dta) is a crosswalk between the contract numbers used by CMS (see [here](https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/carrier-or-mac-number) and [here](https://resdac.org/cms-data/variables/fi-or-mac-number)) and the name of the contractor operating the contract.

[This](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/state_ssafips_Xwalk.dta) is a crosswalk between the state codes used by the Social Security Administration and CMS and the state FIPS codes commonly used elsewhere.

Note that the replication packages available on the pages for my published papers include the publicly available data used in the project, including data on [US Attorney case assignment and court caseloads](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/QAGBDM), [rainfall](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tjkz6ph8u01iopmaqorje/MunicipalRainfall.zip?rlkey=ei6ubo1bkyx5b57k2kspto26v&dl=0), and [private prices for dialysis](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tjkz6ph8u01iopmaqorje/MunicipalRainfall.zip?rlkey=ei6ubo1bkyx5b57k2kspto26v&dl=0).
