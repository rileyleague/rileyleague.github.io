## Dialysis
***

### [The Effect of Bundled Payments on Provider Behavior and Patient Outcomes](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/effect-of-bundled-payments)
with Paul Eliason, Ben Heebsh, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Revise & Resubmit at _American Economic Review_, [Link](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/bundledpayments.pdf)

**Takeaway:** A switch from fee-for-service to a bundled payment led dialysis care providers to dramatically reduce the use of a controversial drug, causing spillovers to treatments outside the bundle but better targeting doses to patients that benefit more from the drug.

### [Ambulance Taxis: The Impact of Regulation and Litigation on Health Care Fraud](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/ambulancefraud)
with Paul Eliason, Jetson Leder-Luis, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Working Paper, [Link](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/w29491.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Administrative actions have a much larger impact on health care fraud than targeted criminal and civil enforcement in the context of non-emergent ambulance services for dialysis patients.

### [High Prices and Wide Dispersion in Private Insurance Payments for Dialysis](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/privateprices)
with Paul Eliason, Ryan McDevitt, Jimmy Roberts, and Heather Wong \
Under Review

**Takeaway:** The price paid by private insurers for dialysis is more than six times the Medicare rate, and in some states the private price is much higher.

### [Large Increases in Health Care Spending Among Privately Insured Patients Initiating Dialysis Care](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/privateinitiate)
with Paul Eliason, Ryan McDevitt, Jimmy Roberts, and Heather Wong \
Under Review

**Takeaway:** Total health care spending increases by roughly $14,000 per month when privately insured enrollees start dialysis.

## Medicare Administration
***

### [Global Knowledge Spillovers and Technology Diffusion: The Case of New Medical Procedures](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/globalspillovers)
Work in Progress

**Takeaway:** Information gained by physicians with exogenous incentives to adopt a new technology spilled over to later-adopting physicians, contributing to the rapid adoption and diffusion of extended Holter monitors.

### [The Impact of Private Medicare Administrators on Health Care Delivery](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/MAC_effect)
Work in Progress

**Takeaway:** Medicare's decentralized structure contributes to geographic variation in health care spending.

## Rainfall Shocks and Social Programs
***

### [School, Shocks, and Safety Nets: Can Conditional Cash Transfers Protect Human Capital Investments During Rainfall Shocks?](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/school-shocks-safetynets)

with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Journal of Development Studies_, 2021, [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2021.1928640?src=)

**Takeaway:** Positive rainfall shocks cause lower-income children in Brazil to substitute away from schooling and toward paid labor, but the Bolsa Família program acts as a partial safety net that stabilises human capital investments during short-run shocks.

### [The Impact of Early-Life Shocks on Adult Welfare in Brazil: Questions of Measurement and Timing](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/impact-of-early-life)
with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Journal of Economics & Human Biology_, 2020, [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19301807)

**Takeaway:** Early-life rainfall shocks can cause negative consequences into adulthood, but researchers should pay more attention to specific measurement and timing choices.

### [Early-Life Shocks and Childhood Social Programs: Evidence of Catch-Up in Brazil](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/catchup)
with Dylan Fitz \
Working Paper, [Link](http://rileyleague.github.io/files/catchup_leaguefitz.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Brazil's Bolsa Família program improves child health and is most effective among children whose in utero conditions predisposed them to worse health outcomes.
