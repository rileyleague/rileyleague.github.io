## [School, Shocks, and Safety Nets: Can Conditional Cash Transfers Protect Human Capital Investments During Rainfall Shocks?](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/school-shocks-safetynets)
with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Journal of Development Studies_, 2021, [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2021.1928640?src=)

**Abstract:** Short-run income shocks can negatively impact school attendance when children are pulled out in order to work, either based on the need for greater income during negative shocks or the increased opportunity cost of child time during positive shocks. This paper proxies for income shocks using fluctuations in local rainfall and evaluates its impact on child schooling, labour force participation, and domestic work. We then investigate whether conditional cash transfers are able to protect school attendance during these temporary shocks. Using data on Brazil’s Bolsa Família programme along with municipal-level rainfall data, we find that positive rainfall shocks cause children to increase the likelihood of paid labour but Bolsa partially mitigates these effects, though less so among boys and older children. Furthermore, we find evidence that even when children do not drop out of school during these shocks, Bolsa may not fully maintain their intensity of school attendance and shocks may hinder academic progress. These results suggest that higher wages cause children to substitute time away from schooling, but that Bolsa acts as a partial safety net that stabilises human capital investments during short-run shocks and may help produce larger long-run benefits.

## [The Impact of Early-Life Shocks on Adult Welfare in Brazil: Questions of Measurement and Timing](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/impact-of-early-life)
with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Journal of Economics & Human Biology_, 2020, [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19301807)

**Abstract:** Recent literature provides evidence that income shocks early in life can have long-run consequences on adult welfare. Rural Brazil frequently suffers from rainfall variations that negatively impact vulnerable households,who often lack the means for coping with these events. This paper evaluates how early-life rainfall shocks influence adult health and socioeconomic outcomes in Brazil. We find evidence that several critical periods can produce long-run consequences. Using rainfall deviations, our two most robust results are that greater rainfall in utero negatively impacts adult incomes (finding that a one standard deviation increase in rainfall causes adult incomes to fall by 7-10 percent) and that greater rainfall in the second and third years of life improve adult health (increasing body mass index by 0.16). However, our results depend crucially on our choices regarding two features. First, our results differ across two common measures of critical periods, which are used to define shocks relative to the timing of one’s birth. Second, the way rainfall variation is measured also matters, with use of an extreme weather indicator suggesting heterogeneous effects by gender, with extreme weather negatively impacting women’s health (both before and after birth) but positively affecting several men’s outcomes (both before and after birth). We find some evidence that mortality selection may drive some of these results. This paper provides further evidence that early-life shocks (from in utero through the third year of life) can cause long-run consequences, but also suggests that more attention should be paid to the specific measurement and timing of rainfall shocks.

## [The Effect of Bundled Payments on Provider Behavior and Patient Outcomes](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/effect-of-bundled-payments)

**Abstract:** We consider how health care providers respond to bundled payments. Using claims data from dialysis patients, we show that facilities halved their use of injectable anemia drugs following Medicare’s transition from fee-for-service reimbursements to a bundle. We identify the causal effects of the payment reform using a novel instrumental variable–patients at higher elevations naturally require lower doses of anemia drugs–and find that lower doses caused a decrease in mortality but an increase in blood transfusions. Allocative efficiency increased from this change as providers reduced doses more for patients who benefit little from the drug.

## [Ambulance Taxis: The Impact of Regulation and Litigation on Health Care Fraud](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/ambulancefraud)
with Paul Eliason, Jetson Leder-Luis, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Work in Progress

**Abstract:** We study the relative effectiveness of administrative regulations, criminal enforcement, and civil whistleblower lawsuits for combatting health care fraud. Between 2003 and 2017, Medicare spent $7.7 billion on 37.5 million regularly scheduled, non-emergency ambulance rides for patients traveling to and from dialysis facilities, with dozens of lawsuits alleging that Medicare reimbursed rides for patients who did not meet the requirements for receiving one. Using a novel data set and an identification strategy based on the staggered timing of regulations and lawsuits across the US, we find that a regulation requiring prior authorization for ambulance reimbursements reduced spending much more than criminal and civil lawsuits did. Despite the sharp drop in both ambulance transports and the companies that provide them following prior authorization, patients’ health outcomes did not change, indicating that most rides were not medically necessary. Our results suggest that administrative actions have a much larger impact than targeted criminal enforcement, providing novel evidence that regulations may be more cost-effective than ex post ligation for preventing health care fraud.

## [Early-Life Shocks and Childhood Social Programs: Evidence of Catch-Up in Brazil](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/catchup)
with Dylan Fitz \
Under Review, [Link](http://rileyleague.github.io/files/catchup_leaguefitz.pdf)

**Abstract:** Early-life shocks often produce negative long-run consequences lasting into adulthood, but little is known about how childhood social programs interact with early-life environments. In this paper, we use delays in enrollment from the rollout of Brazil’s Bolsa Família program to analyze how longer duration of benefit receipt interacts with variation in early-life conditions coming from in utero rainfall shocks. We find that the duration of Bolsa treatment impacts stunting, obesity, and other health outcomes, with the program driving catch-up growth by being most effective among children whose in utero conditions predisposed them to worse health outcomes.

## [High Prices and Wide Dispersion in Private Insurance Payments for Dialysis](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/privateprices)
with Paul Eliason, Ryan McDevitt, Jimmy Roberts, and Heather Wong \
Under Review

**Key Points:** Question: How does the price private insurers pay for hemodialysis services compare to that paid by Medicare, and how does this price vary across time and geography? \
Findings: In this cross-sectional study of a large sample of claims from employer-sponsored insurance plans, we find that the median price paid by private insurers for outpatient hemodialysis services is $1,476, more than six times the base rate paid by Medicare. Furthermore, we find substantial, statistically significant differences in price across states. \
Meaning: Lowering the prices paid by private insurers to Medicare rates and discouraging steering patients onto private plans, as proposed by policymakers, would result in substantial savings in spending on hemodialysis.

## [Global Knowledge Spillovers and Technology Diffusion: The Case of New Medical Procedures](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/globalspillovers)
Work in Progress

**Abstract:** The value of innovative technologies and practices are often initially uncertain, with many entities hesitant to adopt unproven innovations. As the innovation is deployed more widely, it becomes more familiar and the uncertainty surrounding its efficacy dissipates, leading to spillovers in knowledge about the usefulness of the innovation to entities that have not utilized the technology. These knowledge spillovers, rather than being limited to entities that are closely connected to early adopters, may accrue to all entities as the global body knowledge develops. In this paper, I examine how these global knowledge spillovers shape the path of diffusion of new medical technologies. In particular, I exploit geographic variation in the decisions of Medicare to pay for the procedures to identify providers who exogenously adopt the technologies earlier (when information on the new procedure is scarce) or later (when the value of the technology is less uncertain). Thus I am able to identify the value of the knowledge generated by early adopters that spills over to other providers. Using data on extended Holter monitors, I show that although physicians learn from their own experience more than from other physicians, these spillovers are still an important reason why a new medical technology becomes adopted. In counterfactual simulations, I find that a more permissive regulatory regime that takes these knowledge spillovers into account would increase the use of new technologies and accelerate learning by providers. This leads to utilization patterns more similar to those that would obtain under full information, implying improved patient welfare.
