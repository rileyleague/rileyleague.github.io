## [School, Shocks, and Safety Nets: Can Conditional Cash Transfers Protect Human Capital Investments During Rainfall Shocks?](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/school-shocks-safetynets)

with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Journal of Development Studies_, 2021, [Link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2021.1928640?src=)

**Takeaway:** Positive rainfall shocks cause lower-income children in Brazil to substitute away from schooling and toward paid labor, but the Bolsa Família program acts as a partial safety net that stabilises human capital investments during short-run shocks.

## [The Impact of Early-Life Shocks on Adult Welfare in Brazil: Questions of Measurement and Timing](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/impact-of-early-life)
with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Journal of Economics & Human Biology_, 2020, [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19301807)

**Takeaway:** Early-life rainfall shocks can cause negative consequences into adulthood, but researchers should pay more attention to specific measurement and timing choices.

## [The Effect of Bundled Payments on Provider Behavior and Patient Outcomes](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/effect-of-bundled-payments)
with Paul Eliason, Ben Heebsh, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Revise & Resubmit at _American Economic Review_, [Link](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/bundledpayments.pdf)

**Takeaway:** A switch from fee-for-service to a bundled payment led dialysis care providers to dramatically reduce the use of a controversial drug, causing spillovers to treatments outside the bundle but better targeting doses to patients that benefit more from the drug.

## [Ambulance Taxis: The Impact of Regulation and Litigation on Health Care Fraud](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/ambulancefraud)
with Paul Eliason, Jetson Leder-Luis, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Work in Progress

**Takeaway:** Administrative actions have a much larger impact on health care fraud than targeted criminal and civil enforcement in the context of non-emergent ambulance services for dialysis patients.

## [Early-Life Shocks and Childhood Social Programs: Evidence of Catch-Up in Brazil](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/catchup)
with Dylan Fitz \
Under Review, [Link](http://rileyleague.github.io/files/catchup_leaguefitz.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Brazil's Bolsa Família program improves child health and is most effective among children whose in utero conditions predisposed them to worse health outcomes.

## [High Prices and Wide Dispersion in Private Insurance Payments for Dialysis](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/privateprices)
with Paul Eliason, Ryan McDevitt, Jimmy Roberts, and Heather Wong \
Under Review

**Takeaway:** The price paid by private insurers for dialysis is more than six times the Medicare rate, and in some states the private price is much higher.

## [Global Knowledge Spillovers and Technology Diffusion: The Case of New Medical Procedures](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/globalspillovers)
Work in Progress

**Abstract:** The value of innovative technologies and practices are often initially uncertain, with many entities hesitant to adopt unproven innovations. As the innovation is deployed more widely, it becomes more familiar and the uncertainty surrounding its efficacy dissipates, leading to spillovers in knowledge about the usefulness of the innovation to entities that have not utilized the technology. These knowledge spillovers, rather than being limited to entities that are closely connected to early adopters, may accrue to all entities as the global body knowledge develops. In this paper, I examine how these global knowledge spillovers shape the path of diffusion of new medical technologies. In particular, I exploit geographic variation in the decisions of Medicare to pay for the procedures to identify providers who exogenously adopt the technologies earlier (when information on the new procedure is scarce) or later (when the value of the technology is less uncertain). Thus I am able to identify the value of the knowledge generated by early adopters that spills over to other providers. Using data on extended Holter monitors, I show that although physicians learn from their own experience more than from other physicians, these spillovers are still an important reason why a new medical technology becomes adopted. In counterfactual simulations, I find that a more permissive regulatory regime that takes these knowledge spillovers into account would increase the use of new technologies and accelerate learning by providers. This leads to utilization patterns more similar to those that would obtain under full information, implying improved patient welfare.
