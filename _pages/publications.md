## Working Papers and Works in Progress
***

### [Patient Heterogeneity and Treatment Choices: Evidence from the Dialysis Industry](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/epo-elevation)
with Paul Eliason, Ben Heebsh, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Revise & Resubmit at _American Economic Review_, [Link](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/EPOelevation.pdf)

**Takeaway:** A switch from fee-for-service to a bundled payment led dialysis care providers to dramatically reduce the use of a controversial drug, which we show causes adverse events and has widely heterogeneous effects on patient health.

### [Administrative Burden and Consolidation in Health Care: Evidence from Medicare Contractor Transitions](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/MAC_effect)
Working Paper, [Link](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/MAC_transitions.pdf)

**Takeaway:** After being exposed to higher claim denial rates following a change in the contractor processing their Medicare claims, providers invest in billing technology, bill more effectively, and consolidate into larger practices, increasing total Medicare spending and lowering firm profits.

### [Administrative Fragmentation in Health Care](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/AdminFragmentation)
with Maggie Shi \
Working Paper, [Link](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/w33863.pdf)

**Takeaway:** A large reduction in administrative fragmentation in Medicare led to no change in administrative costs or care utilization.

### [Gaming and Effort in Performance Pay](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/QIP)
with Luca Bertuzzi, Paul Eliason, Ben Heebsh, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Working Paper, [Link](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/w31353.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Dialysis firms respond to the prospect of penalties for low quality care by both avoiding patients who would otherwise hurt their scores and&mdash;depending on their financial incentives&mdash;by exerting effort to improve care quality.

### [Equity  Crowdfunding "Rules": Compliance with Mandated Ongoing Financial Reporting in an Unenforced Environment](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/FormC_AR)
with Greg Burke \
Working Paper, [Link](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/ssrn-5463161.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Compliance with ongoing reporting requirements in the ECF market is very low, but a randomized intervention warning issuers about possible regulatory risk raised compliance.

### [Regulation and Diffusion of Innovation Under Information Spillovers: The Case of New Medical Procedures](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/CatIII)
Work in Progress, Contact for Draft

**Takeaway:** Information gained by physicians with exogenous incentives to adopt new medical procedures spills over to later-adopting physicians, contributing to the wider adoption of successful (and deadoption of unsuccessful) innovations. Medicare coverage policies can drive these adoption patterns.

### [Competition and Fraud in Health Care](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/DMEfraud)
with Renuka Diwan, Paul Eliason, Jetson Leder-Luis, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Work in Progress, Contact for Draft

**Takeaway:** Increased competition favors fraudulent firms over legitimate ones in the durable medical equipment market.

### [The Cost of Financial Disclosure for Start-Up Firms: An Examination of Regulation Crowdfunding Offering Closures](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/FormC_A)
with Greg Burke \
Work in Progress, Contact for Draft

**Takeaway:** Most entrepreneurs are willing to close their Regulation Crowdfunding offerings at least two months early to avoid filing updated financial statements with the SEC. 

## Published Papers

### [Ambulance Taxis: The Impact of Regulation and Litigation on Health Care Fraud](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/ambulancefraud)
with Paul Eliason, Jetson Leder-Luis, Ryan McDevitt, and Jimmy Roberts \
Published in _Journal of Political Economy_, 2025, [Published Version](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/Ambulance_Taxis_JPE.pdf), [Working Paper Version](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/w29491.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Administrative actions have a much larger impact on health care fraud than targeted criminal and civil enforcement in the context of non-emergent ambulance services for dialysis patients.

### [Financial Ties, Market Structure, Commercial Prices, and Medical Director Compensation in Dialysis](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/2d)
with Xuyang Xia, Wanrong Deng, Paul Eliason, Ryan McDevitt, Jimmy Roberts, and Heather Wong \
Published in _JAMA Health Forum_, 2025, [Link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2835489)

**Takeaway:** The US dialysis industry has experienced a high degree of both vertical and horizontal consolidation, with monopoly markets having much higher prices for dialysis services and compensation for medical directors.

### [Early-Life Shocks and Childhood Social Programs: Evidence of Catch-Up in Brazil](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/catchup)
with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Journal of Development Studies_, 2023, [Published Version](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2023.2250131), [Working Paper Version](http://rileyleague.github.io/files/catchup_leaguefitz.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Brazil's Bolsa Família program improves child health and is most effective among children whose in utero conditions predisposed them to worse health outcomes.

### [Rogers’ Diffusion Theory of Innovations Applied to the Adoption of Sugammadex in a Nationwide Sample of Hospitals in the United States](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/rogerscurve)
with Kathryn Pearson, Michael Kent, Ryan McDevitt, Matthew Fuller, Rong Jiang, Steve Melton, Vijay Krishnamoorthy, Tetsu Ohnuma, Raquel Bartz, Julien Cobert, and Karthik Raghunathan \
Published in _British Journal of Anaesthesia_, 2023, [Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007091223003665)

**Takeaway:** There is a bell-shaped distribution of the timing of adoption of a new anaesthesia drug, creating opporunities for learning about the causal effect of the drug.

### [Assessment of Health Care Spending Among Privately Insured Patients Initiating Dialysis Care](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/privateinitiate)
with Paul Eliason, Ryan McDevitt, Jimmy Roberts, and Heather Wong \
Published in _JAMA Network Open_, 2022, [Link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2797907?widget=personalizedcontent&previousarticle=0)

**Takeaway:** Total health care spending increases by roughly $14,000 per month when privately insured enrollees start dialysis.

### [Variability of Prices Paid for Hemodialysis by Employer-Sponsored Insurance in the US, 2012-2019](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/privateprices)
with Paul Eliason, Ryan McDevitt, Jimmy Roberts, and Heather Wong \
Published in _JAMA Network Open_, 2022, [Link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2789455)

**Takeaway:** The price paid by private insurers for dialysis is more than six times the Medicare rate, and in some states the private price is much higher.

### [School, Shocks, and Safety Nets: Can Conditional Cash Transfers Protect Human Capital Investments During Rainfall Shocks?](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/school-shocks-safetynets)
with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Journal of Development Studies_, 2021, [Published Version](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00220388.2021.1928640?src=), [Working Paper Version](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/bolsa_schooling.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Positive rainfall shocks cause lower-income children in Brazil to substitute away from schooling and toward paid labor, but the Bolsa Família program acts as a partial safety net that stabilizes human capital investments during short-run shocks.

### [The Impact of Early-Life Shocks on Adult Welfare in Brazil: Questions of Measurement and Timing](https://rileyleague.github.io/publications/impact-of-early-life)
with Dylan Fitz \
Published in _Economics & Human Biology_, 2020, [Published Version](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570677X19301807), [Working Paper Version](https://rileyleague.github.io/files/measurement.pdf)

**Takeaway:** Early-life rainfall shocks can cause negative consequences into adulthood, but researchers should pay more attention to specific measurement and timing choices.
