I'm an Assistant Professor of Finance at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Gies College of Business. I am interested in health economics and industrial organization. My research focuses on the role of administrative burdens in shaping the delivery, cost, and outcomes of health care in the US. I am also interested in the dialysis industry, in which my coauthors and I highlight the consequential role of financial, regulatory, and legal incentives.

Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Health and Aging Research at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) after earning my PhD in Economics from Duke University in May 2023.
