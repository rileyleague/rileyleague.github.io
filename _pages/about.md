I'm a Postdoctoral Fellow in Health and Aging Research at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) interested in health economics and industrial organization. My research focuses on the role of administrative burdens in shaping the delivery, cost, and outcomes of health care in the US. I am also interested in the dialysis industry, in which my coauthors and I highlight the consequential role of financial, regulatory, and legal incentives.

In May 2023, I earned by PhD in Economics from Duke University, and in Fall 2024, I will be joining the Department of Finance at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Gies College of Business.
