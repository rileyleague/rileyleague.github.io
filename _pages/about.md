I'm an economics PhD student at Duke University interested in health economics and industrial organization. My research focuses on the role of administrative burdens in shaping the delivery, cost, and outcomes of health care in the US. I am also interested in the dialysis industry, in which my coauthors and I highlight the consequential role of financial, regulatory, and legal incentives.
