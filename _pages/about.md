I'm an economics PhD student at Duke University interested in health economics and industrial organization. My research focuses on the role of administrative burdens in shaping the delivery, cost, and outcomes of health care in the US. I am also interested in the dialysis industry, in which my coauthors and I highlight the consequential role of financial, regulatory, and legal incentives.

For the coming academic year, I'll be a Postdoctoral Fellow in Health and Aging Research at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) before joining the Department of Finance at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign Gies College of Business in Fall 2024.
