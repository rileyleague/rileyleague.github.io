I'm an economics PhD student at Duke University interested in health economics and industrial organization. My research focuses on the role of private administrative companies in shaping public insurance programs and medical practice. I am also interested in the dialysis industry, in which my coauthors and I highlight the consequential role of financial, regulatory, and legal incentives.
